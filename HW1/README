This folder contains the solution for Projects in Machine Learning and AI - HW1. The folder has three files:

- 'HW1_Logistic_Regression_Implementation' This notebook presents the HW1 solution.
- 'Heart_Disease_Prediction.csv' Public data set used for the purpose of the HW1. The link to the data can be found in the HW1 solution. 

Additional
- 'Logistic_Regression_from_scratch' This notebook presents the batch and minibatch gradient descent implementation codes, along with Adam and Momentum optimizations.
A synthetic data set is created to test this codes.
